        Chicken Karahi is arguably the most popular dish in both Pakistan and India and one that is my absolute
        favorite. But somehow, I could never achieve that flavor and rich brown color the number of times I tried to
        make it at home. Although it came out good, the chicken remained a tad bland; the spices never seeped into the
        meat specially because chicken does not take too long to cook. And then I realized the key ingredient missing
        from my recipe is yogurt!
