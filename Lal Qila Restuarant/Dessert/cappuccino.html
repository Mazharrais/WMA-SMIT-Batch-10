        This is the best cappuccino cake! It has moist coffee cake layers, frosted with coffee
        buttercream and finished with a coffee ganache drip for the best coffee flavor. This cake is perfect for a
        special occasion, and all coffee lovers will love it!

        Dissolve the instant coffee into the vanilla extract in a ramekin. Then to the butter mixture add the eggs and
        vanilla/instant coffee mixture and mix on medium speed until pale in color and smooth.
