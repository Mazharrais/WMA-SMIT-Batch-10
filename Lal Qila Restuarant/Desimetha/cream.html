    <p>
        Whilst crème caramel has a smooth, creamy texture, it's almost gelatine-like (without using gelatine) and
        wobbly. It's much lighter made with full-cream milk (or a mixture of milk and some cream).

        A crème brûlée is made just with cream and more compact. The sugar (normally cassonade or cane sugar) is
        sprinkled on top just before serving then either grilled or "burned" with a blow-torch to make a crackling top.
        The result is not smooth like the crème caramel, but in order to get to the cream the spoon cracks open the
        caramel.
